## Project Overview
In this project we can see a statistical analysis—such as the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum in this way we want to give information about differences between June and December months for temperature that can offered an easy decision to invest his money for both months that represent initial session of the year for summer and winter respectively.

## Results 
For both data portions takes we got similar count of data June count 1700 registers and December 1517 registers, close results for mean minimum and maximum temperature, that information is represented in the next images:
